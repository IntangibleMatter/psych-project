# Lyric Moysey-Rubin's Psych Project 2024

The .pdf file is in the .gitignore so that there won't be merge conflicts on
any machine.

The document is currently set to use MLA format, but can be switched to APA
quite easily. Just let me know. (Although my personal favourite is the
[Vancouver System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_system), due to
it being used by Wikipedia, which I grew up with.)


## Writing format

This document is written in Pandoc's Markdown format.

## To build this you will need

- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org)
    - With [Citeproc](https://github.com/jgm/citeproc) built in. This shouldn't be an issue but it *can* be.
- A plain text editor
    - [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com)
    - [Neovim](https://neovim.io) (this one may have a high learning curve)

Execute the following command to obtain a pdf:
```bash
./build.sh
```

And it should build!

If you run into any issues please let me know.
